## Hey! I'm Navid ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer and designer, currently working as lead software/devops engineer on [JoliStream](https://jolistream.com) and studying computer science in [Semnan Univeristy, Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semnan_University+). I'm trying to learn and experiment with new tools and technologies, meet amazing people, and have a positive effect on the world I'm living in and the people I'm interacting with.
