## Hey! I'm Navid ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer and designer, currently studying computer science in [Semnan Univeristy, Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semnan_University+). I'm trying to learn and experiment with new tools and technologies, meet amazing people, and have a positive effect on the world I'm living in and the people I'm interacting with.


Since I'm currently working on a private project, I don't have much time to contribute to public repos or write blogs. 

Until I have a good enough MVP, you can find more stuff about me on [my website](https://navidmafi.ir)
